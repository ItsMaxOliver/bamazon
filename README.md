#### Instructions

To start, make sure to run the bamazonDB.sql file and run 'npm install' in your terminal. Once you've done that, run 'node bamazonCustomer' to get started.

A numbered list of available items will appear in your terminal with a question that asks you which item you want to buy. 

Type in the number of the item you would like to buy and press enter. The next question will appear which will ask you how many you would like to buy. 

Enter in a quantity and if there are enough items in the store, your order will process and the new stock amount for all items will be displayed. 

If you enter a quantity that is higher than what is in stock, an error message occurs and you are prompted again for which item you want to buy.
